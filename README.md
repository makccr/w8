# W8: The Wonder 8 Calculator
Tired of dropping $10 on a cheeseburger for no good reason? Or $4 on a White Monster or that fancy coffee?

The W8 Calculator shows you exactly how much those little habits are costing you—day by day, month by month, year by year.

###### The W8 (Wonder 8) Calculator assumes the user input represents a habitual, unnecessary spending behavior. It calculates the true cost of this habit by multiplying the entered amount by a frequency: daily, every other day, weekly, monthly, or annually. Then, it projects how much that money could have grown if invested instead. W8 bases its projections on the [historical performance](https://financeband.com/what-is-the-average-return-on-stocks-over-30-years) of the S&P 500, which returned an average of 10.985% annually over the 30 years leading up to December 2024—or 8.262% annually after inflation. These calculations assume dividends are automatically reinvested. All investment projections in W8 use compound interest at an annual rate of 8.262%, providing a realistic, inflation-adjusted estimate of opportunity cost.
